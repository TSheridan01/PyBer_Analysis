## PyBer_Analysis

# Overview of the analysis:


Myself and my boss, Omar were instructed by our boss, to create a graph that indicates the total weekly fares for each city type. Omar and I used our knowlegde of Pandas and Matplotlib to complete this project so my boss will give me a raise. 


# There is a description of the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types. Ride-sharing data include the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type.
#Summary:





# There is a statement summarizing three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types. 

1 -  We need to focus the majority of our capitol on mainting a strong hold on the urban market. This is our crown jewel and the urban city will be the lions share of our business. 80% of our drivers are in urban areas. 

2 - We can slighlty raise our costs in Urban areas. It is currently $6 less then suburban areas and we can liekly raise our Urban cost by $2 and not hurt buisness. 


3 - I would recommend lowering prices in rural areas, the average urban ride costs $16 while the average rural ride costs $55. We need to get that $55 down to increase business.
